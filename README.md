A modified player model prefab from Source2ZE by Darnias, GXP and Kaesar.  Modified mainly to be used for Zombie Escape, or Zombie Survival gamemodes.

Modifications:
  - Added custom proportion constraints (Will break hitbox entirely)
  - Added Rename and Re-align bone nodes to convert Left 4 Dead 2 and Half life 2's armature rig to CS2
  - Added Attachments preview models for easier and precise placement

Note:
  - Despite allowing to convert L4D2 and HL2 humanoid models seamlessly, it is recommendable to perform adjustment beforehand such as scaling up the model because HL2 and L4D2 humanoid are smaller than CS2
  - First person arms are not provided and will require manual work
  - First person legs are not guaranteed to work as should.
